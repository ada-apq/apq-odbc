# APQ - ODBC

These are the - experimental - ODBC implementation of ODBC support
for the APQ Database Bindings.

Since this is an unmaintained experimental version we recommend you
to try one of:


* [apq-ct\_lib](https://github.com/ada-apq/apq-ct_lib) for Sybase and SQL Server bindings.
* [apq-mysql](https://github.com/ada-apq/apq-mysql) for MySQL and MariaDB bindings.
* [apq-postgresql](https://github.com/ada-apq/apq-postgresql) for PostgreSQL bindings.

If you need other vendor please let us know using the github features.
